factRec :: (Integer -> Integer) -> (Integer -> Integer)
factRec f 0 = 1
factRec f m = m * f (m-1)

factFP = factRec factFP

Evaluate factFP 4 by hand.
Formulate an explanation for why factRec should actually define the factorial function.

factFP 4 = 4 * factFP(3)
         = 4 * 3 * factFP(2)
         = 4 * 3 * 2 * factFP(1)
         = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * factFP(0)
         = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1

factFP defines the factorial function by recursion. It multiplies the initial value by factFP
of the next lowest value, recurring until it decrements to 0, at which point it multiplies by 1.
This returns the product of every integer from 1 to m.
